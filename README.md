# jp
jp is a stack based programming language suitable for the full spectrum of low and high level programming. The semantics of the language are the same whether you are programming close to the metal or are using it at a higher more abstract level. This gives you a very powerful programming environment where anything is possible.

One of the main goals of this project is to break free from old, fat, and often buggy, code and start anew with a clean slate to be able to create an elegant and powerful system. For example, it is not possible (and never will be) to call external c libraries (or any other libraries for that matter) since this will negate the 'clean slate' we want to be building from. In fact, the language is not c based in any way. This means there will be very little, if any, support code at first but as the project matures this will change.

The notable exception to this rule is that it is possible to call the OS itself. This is a necessity since the program has to run under the OS and interact with it. But given the spartan nature of the language it is also well suited to thrive in an environment having no OS at all like on a development board having a microcontroller or an ARM.
